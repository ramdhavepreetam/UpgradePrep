Adjacency Matrix

one way of represent a graph.
Pros of using Adj
 - Space efficient for representing the dense graph
 - Edge weight lookup is O(1)
 - Simple Graph represent
Cons of using Adj
 - Requires O(v^2) space
 - iterating over all edges takes O(V^2)

Top Sort
- School class schedule
- Program Dependencies
- Event Scheduling
- Assembly instructions

The main thing is thing are dependent this time we should use top sort.
Example is if you enroll a class in you have to take a order of classes. if this type of class schedule occur then
top sort algo will not give the answer.

Another example is Programable Dependency
   a. if a program a is depend on dependancy x
   b x is dependent on y and y is dependant on z
then in order to execute the program a you need to have z --> y --> x --> a to satisfy this
A topsort algo is and ordering of a node in a directed graph where each directed edge from node
A to node B , node A appears before node B in the ordering

The Complexity is O(V + E)
it has to be a directed Graph.
